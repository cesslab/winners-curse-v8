  <p>You estimated the highest of the other 3 bids to be between

  <h4>Correct Answer</h4>
  <p>The highest bid of the other three bidders was <span class="credits">C</span>{{others_high_bid}}.</p>

  <h4>Your earnings</h4>
  <p>Your earnings in this round are <span class="credits">C</span>{{earnings}}.</p>

    {% if high_bid_within_interval %}

      The highest bid was within your chosen interval, and given your interval's width you get <span class="credits">C</span>{{interval_earnings}}.
      {% else %}
      The highest bid was within your chosen interval, but your interval was too wide. Therefore, you get <span class="credits">C</span>{{interval_earnings}}.

    {% else %}
    The highest bid was not within your chosen interval, therefore you get <span class="credits">C</span>{{interval_earnings}}.

  </p>
  <p>
    Given your best guess the probability of getting 12 credits was {{ prob_k_greater_than_l }}%. To compute your payoff the computer
    used a random device with this probability and you get <span class="credits">C</span>{{guess_earnings}}.

    In total, you get <span class="credits">C</span>{{ earnings }}.
