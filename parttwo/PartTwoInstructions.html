<h3>Part II</h3>
<p>
  You will now start Part II of the experiment. Part II also consists of 20 rounds.
</p>
<p>
  In these 20 rounds, you will see the same lottery tickets than in the 20 rounds of Part I, but now we ask you to place
  a bid for each of the lottery tickets. After you have submitted your bid, you will learn what the actual lottery ticket
  was, the highest bid in the auction, whether or not you won the auction and your payoff in the auction.
