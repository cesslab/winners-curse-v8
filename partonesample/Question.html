  Before you place your bid, we ask you to guess the highest bid among the three other bidders.
  You will earn 12 credits if your guess is sufficiently close to the highest bid; and nothing if it is too far away.
  How close your guess is to the highest bid regulates your chance of getting 12 credits:
  The further away your guess is from the highest bid, the lower is the probability that you get 12 credits.
