<p>
  For instance, if you bid <span class="credits">C</span>8 for a lottery that pays off, on average,
  <span class="credits">C</span>10, you would expect a profit of <span class="credits">C</span>2 if you
  played the lottery very often, but you may not win the auction. If instead you bid <span class="credits">C</span>12,
  you are more likely to win the auction, but you would make on average a loss of <span class="credits">C</span>2 if
  you won and played the lottery repeatedly. Of course, if you win the auction, you only play the lottery once;
  At the end, whether you lose or win credits depends on whether the lottery outcome realizes below or above your bid.
