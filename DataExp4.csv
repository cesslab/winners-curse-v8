Till and until the probability is really high, I have put 0's because the maximum that you can earn (if you are lucky) then 8 credits which corresponds to nearly $1 and 0.75 of $1 is 75 cents. So basically maximum you can earn is 75cents but if you bid high like 44 and lose, here you are losing a lot. I'd rather have 0 earnings than negative earnings",The same answer as the previous one. Here the False Positives come with a big penalty,"I would just like to earn something. In Lottery A you get 75 and in B minimum is 60, so I might be losing out on 0.75*(75-60) but atleast B is less risky",Same as previous,88,0,1,43,10,,3,0,0,0,0,68,,15,0,60,50,34,86,1,60,60,-14,.032258064,1,1,36,.0039660037,27.6,26.16,25.202379,-14.16,-13.202379,-15.6,2.3976212,0,1,1,1,60,0,1,1,1,-14,0,.2,-1.6094379,0,0,0,0,0,0,,2.4849067,3.2269385,3.2642314,3.3178158,4.0943446,3.8286414,4.0943446,1,0,20,42.003967,43.599998,0,0,-8.3999996,-2.3976212,70.55999,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,1,15,0,130,27.416666,1,17,1,27,0,0,0,19,130,15,42,4,30,,,,60,0,0,-48,14,.0033333334,-.23333333,.06666667,41.65588,20.890141,,,,,1.1733333,.20499995,-.0050000548,,,-.17333329,.20499995,-.0050000548,-1,1,1,41.65588,20.890141,4,1,1,.43599999,25.16
