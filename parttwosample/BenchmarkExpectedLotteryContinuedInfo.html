  Note that by bidding slightly below that, if you were to win, you would, on average, not lose money. However, such a
  bid does not maximize your chances of winning, so you will have to trade off your chances of winning (by bidding
  above your estimate of the highest of the other 3 bids), and your chances of making a profit if you win (by bidding
  below the expected payoff of the lottery).
