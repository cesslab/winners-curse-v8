  For example, if you choose a narrow interval from 1 to 2, and the highest bid is indeed between 1 and 2, then you
  would get <span class="credits">C</span>11 (this may slightly vary with the type of lottery).
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, if you choose a wider interval from 72 to 92, and the highest bid is indeed between 72 and 92, then
  your earnings would be only <span class="credits">C</span>2 since, despite the fact that the highest bid was within the
  interval you chose, the interval was wide and hence you earned less.

<p>
  If the highest bid is outside your chosen interval you will get nothing.
