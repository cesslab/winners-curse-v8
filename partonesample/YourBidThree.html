An alternative way to bid is to bid slightly below the expected payoff of the lottery given your signal is the highest
  one (the expected payoff is on the screen). Note that by bidding slightly below that, if you were to win, you would,
  on average, not lose money. However, such a bid does not maximize your chances of winning, so you will have to
  trade off your chances of winning (by bidding above your estimate of the highest of the other 3 bids), and your chances of
