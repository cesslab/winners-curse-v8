 One benchmark is your estimate of the highest of the other 3 bids that you have already stated. This is what in Part I,
 in the same auction, you thought the highest bid of the other 3 bidders would be. If your estimate is correct, then
 if you bid above that, you will win the auction and earn the difference between the outcome of the lottery and your bid.
 Such a bid will maximize your chances of winning (assuming you made a correct prediction), but if you win, your profits
 may be small or negative depending on the lottery outcome and on how high your estimate of the highest of the other
  three bids was.
