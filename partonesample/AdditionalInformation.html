<p>In addition, we tell you that among all four bidders <b>you are the one who has the highest signal.</b>
You are the only one to know this information; the other three bidders know their signal only but not its rank in the set all four biddersâ€™ signals.
</p>
<p>
  Given that your signal is the highest one, you can expect the actual lottery ticket to be as shown on the screen.
  That is, because your signal is the highest one, the {{ player.selected_value_text }} is likely below your signal and, according to the
  laws of probability theory the actual lottery ticket is probably equal or close to the blue one displayed on the right.
</p>
<p>
  The lottery pays off sometimes zero, sometimes the {{ player.selected_value_text }}. Taking into account the probability of getting the
  {{ player.selected_value_text }}, you see what you would get, on average, if you play this lottery very often.
