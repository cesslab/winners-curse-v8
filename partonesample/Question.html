  Before you place your bid, we ask you to guess what you think the highest bid among the three other bidders will be.
  You will earn 12 credits if your guess is sufficiently close to the highest bid; and nothing if it is too far away.
  How close your guess is to the highest bid regulates your chance of getting 12 credits:
  The further away your guess is from the highest bid, the lower is the probability that you get 12 credits.

<p><b>It can be shown that the best you can do is to state what you truly believe the highest bid among the
  other three bidders to be.</b></p>
