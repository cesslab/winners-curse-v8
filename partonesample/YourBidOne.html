Your bid determines your payoff and your chances of winning the auction: The lower the bid you will have to pay,
  the higher the profit you will make if you win the auction, but the lower your chances of winning the auction.
  Vice versa, the higher your bid, the higher your chances of winning the auction, but the lower your profit if you
  win the auction.
